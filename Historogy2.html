  <p><b>1. Describe the structure and functions of epithelial tissue.</b></p>
  <span class="reveal" onclick="toggleAnswer('essay1')">Show Expected Answer</span>
  <div id="essay1" class="answer">
    <p>Epithelial tissue is composed of tightly packed cells with minimal extracellular material. It covers body surfaces, lines organs, and forms glands. The cells have polarity (apical, lateral, basal surfaces) and rest on a basement membrane. Functions include protection, absorption, secretion, sensation, and contractility.</p>

<div class="essay">
  <p><b>2. Explain the different types of epithelial cells based on their shape and layers, giving examples of each.</b></p>
  <span class="reveal" onclick="toggleAnswer('essay2')">Show Expected Answer</span>
  <div id="essay2" class="answer">
    <p>Epithelia are classified by the number of layers and cell shape. Simple epithelia (one layer) include simple squamous (lungs), simple cuboidal (kidney tubules), and simple columnar (intestines). Stratified epithelia (many layers) include stratified squamous (skin), and transitional (urinary bladder). Pseudostratified epithelium (trachea) appears multilayered but is single-layered.</p>
